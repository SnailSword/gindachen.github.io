## Finally started my blog
Just a place holder here for now. I finally got the chance to start my blog. I have always wanted to write about my thoughts and experiences, but everytime I wanted to do so, I was either interrupted by work & other commitments, or simply picking the right theme for too long until I time out. This time, I'm just allocating a whole day to find somewhere to start my journey. The blog theme is going to change a lot - we will come back to those improvements later.


## Hugo + PaperModX
PaperModX is a pretty nice fork from PaperMod theme. I like the simplicity and the clean design, but also the flexibility to customize it. Compared to the jekelly academic, Hugo is generally fast to build (so I chose Hugo); and compared to other themes, the PaperMod family is simply and clean, thus allowing me to customize it easily. 


There are still a pile of todos while I'm setting up the blog:
- [ ] Text color. In dark mode, clicking "publication" in the nav bar will make the text "disappear" because the text color is black.
- [ ] The search function is not working. I need to figure out how to make it work.
- [ ] Theme color. Maybe find a better theme color for the webpage. Even better, we can let user tweak the variable in runtime.
- [ ] Profile page name text color. The dark / white is a little to pale. 
- [ ] Profile page photo will be squashed when the width is too small. Maybe set a min width is helpful.
- [ ] Profile page layout. The layout is centralized, and the flow of text isn't that good. Maybe we can make it better.
- [ ] Profile page + selected publications.
