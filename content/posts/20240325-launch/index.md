## Finally started my blog!
Just a place holder here for now. I finally got the chance to start my blog. I have always wanted to write about my thoughts and experiences, but everytime I wanted to do so, I was either interrupted by work & other commitments, or simply picking the right theme for too long until I time out. This time, I'm just allocating a whole day to find somewhere to start my journey. The blog theme is going to change a lot - we will come back to those improvements later.


## First try: Hugo + PaperModX
PaperModX is a pretty nice fork from PaperMod theme. I like the simplicity and the clean design, but also the flexibility to customize it. Compared to the jekelly (which has a beautiful [`alfolio`](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme), Hugo is generally fast to build (so I chose Hugo); and compared to other themes, the PaperMod family is simply and clean, thus allowing me to customize it easily. 

## Next Step: Enhancements
There are still a pile of todos while I'm setting up the blog:
- [ ] Text color. In dark mode, clicking "publication" in the nav bar will make the text "disappear" because the text color is black.
- [x] Search. The search function is not working. I need to figure out how to make it work.
- [ ] Theme color. Maybe find a better theme color for the webpage. Even better, we can let user tweak the variable in runtime.
- [ ] Profile page name text color. The dark / white is a little to pale. 
- [ ] Adding more color theme for papermod. I need higher constrast theme to work better.
- [ ] Version control for article. Can I have a version control system (for reader) to see how the article has changed over time? It would be sooo cool to compare what has changed (diff) and a time-machine-like feature to visualize how the article evolves.
- [ ] Profile page photo will be squashed when the width is too small. Maybe set a min width is helpful.
- [ ] Profile page layout. The layout is centralized, and the flow of text isn't that good. Maybe we can make it better.
- [x] Profile page + selected publications. 
- [ ] Adding a single script to produce publication list. I used `scholarly` to produce part of the publications, but the workflow isn't as smooth as I expected yet.
- [ ] General theme and layout. I always feel a little weird about the styling of the webpage. For example, why is there a bullt in front of the todo item? Why can't I click the todo box to mark it as done (in html)? 
- [ ] Add comment services.
- [ ] Add a "like" button for each article.
- [ ] Add a GPT to "summarize" / "shorten". Maybe we can use [MLC](https://webllm.mlc.ai/) to do the computation on browser?

## Future: What to write?

I have always imagined my blog to be a place where I can share thoughts, show some cool stuff, and some small ideas in progress to the world. 
- [ ] Write a mini LLM serving engine from scratch. Engines like [vLLM](https://vllm.ai/), [SGLang](https://lmsys.org/blog/2024-01-17-sglang/), [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM) are cool but monsterous (for many). Having a mini version of it would be cool. See if we have the chance to evolve the serving sytem from static batching -> adding DP -> adding TP -> adding PP -> adding [continuous batching](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/continuous-batching-llm-inference), and finally to our [model disaggregation](https://hao-ai-lab.github.io/blogs/distserve/). Is this already a pretty standard project for LLM system course?
