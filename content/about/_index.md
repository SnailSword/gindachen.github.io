title: About Me
---
Welcome to my personal website! 

I am a 1st year PhD student at [Dept. Computer Science and Engineering at UC SanDiego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/). 

I am currently under rotation, and had worked with [Yiying Zhang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~yiying/) and [Hao Zhang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haozhang/) during the past quarters. 

I graduated as a ~~Ph.D.~~ master student in the Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by [Jignesh Patel](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jignesh/) and was a part of the [UW-Madison Database Group](https://twitter.com/wiscdb?lang=en). My research interests lie in the intersection of databases and data analytics systems. I was particularly interested in building systems that enable users to interact with data in a more intuitive and efficient manner. 

I am also passionate about teaching and mentoring. 
During my years in DataChat, I also mentored 10+ colleagues and interns during work and after, and some of them become successful as leaders in the company or in their own careers.

I always reflect back on my journey in DataChat after starting my PhD: What have I done right? What are the stuff that I wish I could improve? What inspired me and shaped my core value in my career? What have I missed out? What would I do if I start over again? What did the company do well / need improvement? 

As a result, I decided to write something about my journey in DataChat, and share some thoughts and experiences with people. I wrote this under the name of "Alice", a fictional character who embarks her journey in the Wondertech, a small startup company, and learns about the world of engineering, leadership, and life. It is not meant to be only a reflection of my journey - it is an invitation to everyone who is interested in being successful in a tech company to collectively think about important topics in different stages of their career: the excitement, the frustration, the joy, the sadness, the success, the failure, the growth, the stagnation, the leadership, the teamwork, the innovation, the legacy, the future - all of these are the elements that I hope as an invitation of discussion to include different journeys and experiences under the hood of Alice.

**Progress (2024/3)**: I have organized a preliminary talk, and had presented in some small "meetup" style events. I am currently working on the first draft of the slide deck, which includes 9 chapters and I'm still on chapter 3... The more important thing is to make it interactive - possibly with AI - to engage people in the discussion, and to get feedback from them.
