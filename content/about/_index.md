title: About Me
---
Welcome to my personal website! 

I am a 1st year PhD student at [Dept. Computer Science and Engineering at UC SanDiego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/). 

I am currently under rotation, and had worked with [Yiying Zhang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~yiying/) and [Hao Zhang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haozhang/) during the past quarters. 

I graduated as a ~~Ph.D.~~ master student in the Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by [Jignesh Patel](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jignesh/) and was a part of the [UW-Madison Database Group](https://twitter.com/wiscdb?lang=en). My research interests lie in the intersection of databases and data analytics systems. I was particularly interested in building systems that enable users to interact with data in a more intuitive and efficient manner. 

I am also passionate about teaching and mentoring. 
During my years in DataChat, I also mentored 10+ colleagues and interns during work and after, and some of them become successful as leaders in the company or in their own careers.
